Functional programming --> Paradigm (paradiam pronunciation) shift --> Meaning, think in a functional programming

In a stream, we intermediate operation and finally terminate the operation
Example:
list.stream.distinct() //Strea<T> Intermediate operation
.sorted() //intermediate operation
.forEach(SOUT)// void termination operation
----
.collect(Collector.toList()); //R--> Return

Functional Interfaces  - It has exactly one abstract method -->
- Predicate  -->
- Consumer   -->
- Function   -->



//HighOrderFunction  -> Returns a another function has the return value

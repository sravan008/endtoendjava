/*

We have a graph and we want to visit every node : we can do with BFS
The aim is to visit every vertex exactly once
Running complexity --> o(v+e)
Memory complexity is not good because we have to store lots of references
Advantage of BFS is - shortest path, Dijkstra's algorithm - Does a breath-first search if all the edge weights are equal to 1
